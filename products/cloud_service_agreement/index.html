</ol>
</li>

<ol>
<li>Recipient knew without any obligation of confidentiality before disclosure by Discloser;</li>
<li>is or becomes publicly known and generally available through no fault of Recipient;</li>

<li>Recipient independently developed without use of or reference to Discloser’s Confidential Information.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><strong>Permitted Disclosures.</strong> Recipient may disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to Users, employees, advisors, contractors, and representatives who each have a need to know the Confidential Information, but only if the person or entity is bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those in this Section 12 and Recipient remains responsible for everyone’s compliance with the terms of this Section 12.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="reservation-of-rights">Reservation of Rights</h4>

<h4 id="general-terms">General Terms</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement is the only agreement between the parties about its subject and this Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous statements (whether in
writing or not) about its subject. Provider expressly rejects any terms included in Customer’s purchase order or similar document, which may only be used for accounting or administrative
purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Modifications, Severability, and Waiver.</strong> Any waiver, modification, or change to the Agreement must be in writing and signed or electronically accepted by each party. However,
Provider may update Technical Support, the SLA, the Security Policy, or the Acceptable Use Policy by giving Customer 30 days prior notice. During the 30-day notice period, Customer may
terminate the Agreement or affected Order Form upon notice if the update is a material reduction from the prior version and Provider cannot reasonably restore the prior version or a
comparable alternative. If any term of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a relevant court or governing body, the remaining terms of this Agreement will remain
in full force and effect. The failure of a party to enforce a term or to exercise an option or right in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver by that party of the term, option, or
right.</li>
<li><strong>Governing Law and Chosen Courts.</strong> The Governing Law will govern all interpretations and disputes about this Agreement, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The parties
will bring any legal suit, action, or proceeding about this Agreement in the Chosen Courts and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts.</li>
<li><strong>Injunctive Relief.</strong> Despite Section 14.3 (Governing Law and Chosen Courts), a breach of Section 12 (Confidentiality) or the violation of a party’s intellectual property rights may
cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages cannot adequately compensate. As a result, upon the actual or threatened breach of Section 12 (Confidentiality) or violation of a party’s
intellectual property rights, the non-breaching or non-violating party may seek appropriate equitable relief, including an injunction, in any court of competent jurisdiction without the
need to post a bond and without limiting its other rights or remedies.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Exhaustive Remedies.</strong> Except where the Agreement provides for an exclusive remedy, seeking or exercising a remedy does not limit the other rights or remedies available to a party.</li>
<li><strong>Assignment.</strong> Neither party may assign any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. However, either party may assign this
Agreement upon notice if the assigning party undergoes a merger, change of control, reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all its equity, business, or assets to which this
Agreement relates. Any attempted but non-permitted assignment is void. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.</li>
<li><strong>No Publicity.</strong> Neither party may publicly announce the existence of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.</li>
<li><strong>Notices.</strong> Any notice, request, or approval about the Agreement must be in writing and sent to the Notice Address. Notices will be deemed given (a) upon confirmed delivery if by
email, registered or certified mail, or personal delivery; or (b) two days after mailing if by overnight commercial delivery.</li>
<li><strong>Independent Contractors.</strong> The parties are independent contractors, not agents, partners, or joint venturers. Neither party is authorized to bind the other to any liability or
obligation.</li>
<li><strong>No Third-Party Beneficiary.</strong> There are no third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Force Majeure.</strong> Neither party will be liable for a delay or failure to perform its obligations of this Agreement if caused by a Force Majeure Event. However, this section does not
excuse Customer’s obligations to pay fees.</li>
<li><strong>Export Controls.</strong> Customer may not remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of the Product or any related technology or materials in violation of any
restrictions, laws, or regulations of the United States Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other United States or
foreign agency or authority.</li>
<li><strong>Government Rights.</strong> The Cloud Service and Software are deemed “commercial items” or “commercial computer software” according to FAR section 12.212 and DFAR section 227.7202, and the
Documentation is “commercial computer software documentation” according to DFAR section 252.227-7014(a)(1) and (5). Any use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or
disclosure of the Product by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by the terms of this Agreement and all other use is prohibited.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-Bribery.</strong> Neither party will take any action that would be a violation of any Applicable Laws that prohibit the offering, giving, promising to offer or give, or receiving,
directly or indirectly, money or anything of value to any third party to assist Provider or Customer in retaining or obtaining business. Examples of these kinds of laws include the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010.</li>
<li><strong>Titles and Interpretation.</strong> Section titles are for convenience and reference only. All uses of “including” and similar phrases are non-exhaustive and without limitation. The United
Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act do not apply to this Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Signature.</strong> This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, including by electronic copies or acceptance mechanism. Each copy will be deemed an original and all copies, when taken together, will be the same agreement.</li>
